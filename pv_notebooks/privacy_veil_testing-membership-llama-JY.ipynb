    "- This notebook tests an LLM for sensitive information disclosure. It tests for sensitive information as well as membership disclosure based on a tabular dataset. Prompt injection tests are created in json format and stored in a separate file. \n",
    "- It provides an option for prompt repetition to increase the number of test runs for the group of tests in the json file. \n",
    "- It prints the prompt and expected response, and the LLM actual response. It shows an indicator of SID for the operator to examine, and provide a report. \n",
    "- The output is stored in a yaml file to the operators local disk.\n",
